*   **Design of Reuse Systems:**  Provides calculations for sizing storage reservoirs, distribution networks, and irrigation systems using treated wastewater.

### C. Desalination (Secondary Focus)

While important for specific coastal regions, desalination is considered a secondary focus due to its higher cost and energy intensity.

*   **Cost Analysis:**  Estimates the cost of desalinated water, considering:
    *   Plant capacity.
    *   Technology (reverse osmosis, thermal desalination).
    *   Energy source (grid electricity, renewable energy).
    *   Intake and outfall design.
    *   Pretreatment requirements.

*   **Energy Optimization (Advanced):**  Future development may include simulating the energy consumption of different desalination processes.

*   **Brine Management:**  Evaluates the environmental impact of brine discharge and explores mitigation options.

## App Structure and Features

*   **Project-Based Workflow:** The app is organized around a project-based workflow. Users create and manage individual projects (e.g., "Wastewater Treatment Plant Design," "Irrigation System Optimization"). This allows for:
    *   **Contextualized Tools:**  The app presents only the relevant tools and calculations for the selected project type.
    *   **Data Persistence:**  Project data (inputs, calculations, results) can be saved and loaded, facilitating iterative design and analysis.
    *   **Organized Workflow:** Users are guided through the steps required for their specific task.

*   **Modular Design:** The app is organized into modules for each focus area (Irrigation Optimization, Wastewater Reuse, Desalination), allowing for phased development and future expansion. The initial focus is on **Municipal Wastewater Treatment**.

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for a range of users, from students to professional engineers, with clear language, intuitive controls, and visual aids (charts, graphs, maps).

*   **Localized Data:** Integrates Moroccan-specific data, including:
    *   Climate data (rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration) from Moroccan weather stations.
    *   Soil data relevant to Moroccan agriculture.
    *   Crop coefficients for crops commonly grown in Morocco.
    *   Moroccan water quality standards and regulations.
    *   Cost data for water, energy, and chemicals in Morocco.

*   **Reporting:** Generates clear and concise reports summarizing calculation results and simulations.

*   **Multilingual Support:** The app is planned to be available in Arabic, French, and English to maximize accessibility.

## Initial Focus: Municipal Wastewater Treatment

The first version of the app will focus on providing tools for designing and simulating municipal wastewater treatment plants. This includes:

* **Project Creation Wizard:** A step-by-step guide to set up a new wastewater treatment project.
* **Influent Characterization:** Module for inputting wastewater flow rate and composition (BOD, TSS, etc.).
* **Preliminary Treatment:** Design tools for screens and grit chambers.
* **Primary Treatment:** Design tools for primary clarifiers (rectangular and circular).
* **Secondary Treatment:** Design tools for activated sludge systems (CSTR with recycle), including aeration requirements.
* **Secondary Clarification:** Design of secondary clarifiers.
* **Data Saving and Loading:** Ability to save and load project data.

## Why These Priorities?

*   **Irrigation Optimization:** Agriculture is the largest water consumer in Morocco. Improving irrigation efficiency offers the greatest potential for water savings.
*   **Wastewater Reuse:** A rapidly growing and strategically important area for sustainable water management in Morocco.
*   **Desalination:** Important in specific coastal areas, but less universally applicable than efficiency improvements and reuse due to its higher cost and energy footprint.

## Future Development

The app will be continuously updated and expanded with new features and modules based on user feedback and evolving needs in the Moroccan water sector. This includes expanding to other project types (e.g., irrigation optimization, desalination feasibility studies) and adding more advanced modeling capabilities.

### LGPLv3 (Qt Framework)

Using Qt under the LGPLv3 has the following implications:

*   **Free Use:** You can use Qt for free in this open-source project.
*   **Source Code Availability:** The source code of *this application* is made available under the MIT License (see above).  This satisfies a key requirement of the LGPLv3.
*   **Qt Source Code:** You are *not* required to modify the Qt libraries.  However, the LGPLv3 requires that users have access to the Qt source code.  This is typically satisfied by providing a link to the official Qt website: [https://www.qt.io/download-open-source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
*   **Dynamic Linking:** This application uses dynamic linking to the Qt libraries (this is the default behavior for PySide6/PyQt). This is important for LGPLv3 compliance.
*   **Modifications to Qt:** If you *do* make any modifications to the Qt libraries themselves (which is unlikely), you *must* release those modifications under the LGPLv3.
*   **Relinking:** Users have the right to relink the application with a modified version of the Qt libraries (though this is an advanced use case).

**Commercial Use and Monetization (Clarification):**

The combination of the MIT License for your application code and the LGPLv3 for Qt allows for various monetization strategies, even though the source code is open:

*   **Selling Support and Maintenance:** You can charge for providing support, maintenance, and custom development services.
*   **Selling Additional Features (Open Core Model):** You could release a "core" version of the app under the MIT license and offer additional, proprietary features as paid plugins or extensions.  *However*, any code that *links* with Qt must still comply with the LGPLv3.
*   **Selling Pre-Compiled Binaries:** You can sell pre-compiled versions of your application for convenience, even though the source code is available.
*   **Dual Licensing (More Advanced):** You *could* offer your application under *both* the MIT license (for open-source users) *and* a separate commercial license (for users who want to avoid the LGPLv3 obligations of Qt and keep their modifications private). This is a more complex approach.

**Disclaimer:** This licensing information is for *informational purposes only* and should not be considered legal advice. If you have any questions about licensing, consult with a legal professional.
